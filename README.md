# Relationship Red Flag Evaluator

This project is designed to take copy-pasted text conversations and evaluate them for common relationship dynamic red flags. It aims to help users identify potentially unhealthy or problematic patterns in their interactions.

## Features

- Analyze for common red flags in relationship dynamics
- Provide feedback and warnings based on analysis

## Getting Started

To run the evaluator, use Node.js to execute the `index.js` script.

```

## Future Plans

- Improve analysis with natural language processing
- Add a web interface for easier use
- Expand red flag detection rules# RedFlagChecker
