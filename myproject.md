# Project: Relationship Red Flag Evaluator

## Overview
This project aims to analyze copy-pasted text conversations to detect common relationship dynamic red flags. The initial version is a Node.js CLI tool that accepts pasted text input and performs simple pattern matching to identify potential red flags.

## Current Status
- Project directory and initial files created.
- README.md with project description and usage instructions.
- index.js CLI script implemented with basic red flag detection logic.
- myproject.md created to track project progress and notes.

## To-Do
- Expand red flag detection rules with more sophisticated patterns.
- Integrate natural language processing for better context understanding.
- Add unit tests for analysis functions.
- Create a web interface for easier user interaction.
- Improve UX for CLI input and output formatting.

## Lessons Learned
- Starting with a simple CLI prototype helps validate core functionality quickly.
- Clear project documentation is essential for future development and collaboration.

## Next Steps
- Implement additional red flag detection heuristics.
- Research NLP libraries suitable for relationship text analysis.
- Plan web interface design and technology stack.
